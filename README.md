- Hi, I’m @d-seibert121, an (as-of-yet) amateur, mostly self-taught, programmer. 
- I’m interested in mathematics, particularly topics such as group theory, graph theory, and 
- I’m currently expanding my knowledge of Python to various third party libraries such as pandas and numpy, as well as branching into other languages such as C++ and Java
- You can reach me via email at my handle here (with an underscore instead of a dash) at gmail.com
